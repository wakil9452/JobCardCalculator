Job Card Calculator ⚙️
This project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed and developed by Sudhanshu Kumar Tiwari. It serves as a handy tool for calculating job card completion times efficiently.

About the Project
The Job Card Calculator is designed to help users determine the optimal and rounded completion times for a job, based on assigned work hours, start time, and shift schedules. It accounts for various factors, including:

Day and Night Shifts: The application correctly calculates hours based on different shift timings.

Weekend and Holidays: It automatically skips Sundays and any national holidays you specify.

Data Persistence: Your calculated job cards are saved locally in the browser, allowing you to access them even without an internet connection. You can also export this data to a CSV file for easy record-keeping.

PWA Functionality: As a PWA, this application can be installed on your desktop or mobile device, giving you a native app experience without needing an app store.

How to Use
Enter Assigned Time: Input the total hours and minutes assigned for the job.

Set Start Time: Choose the date and time when the job card was started.

Specify Holidays: Enter any national holidays to be excluded from the calculation.

Calculate: Click the "Calculate 'Out' Times" button to get the projected completion times.

Save: If you are satisfied with the result, you can save the job card for future reference.
